Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
And that's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter
What my friends say
There's a message in the wild
And I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand
And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
But I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what I might say
And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload
'Cause I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what I might say
I ain't missing you (I ain't missing you)
No way
Since you've been gone away (I can lie to myself these days)
I ain't missing you
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
And I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say
I ain't missing you
I ain't missing you (I can lie to myself these days)
I ain't missing you at all, I ain't missing you (No way, baby)
No matter what my friends say (I'm doing fine here)
And I ain't missing you at all
I ain't missing you
I keep lying to myself every time I think of you
I'm okay
I'm doing fine here from day to day
I ain't missing you
I can lie to myself
